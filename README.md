My team and I created this for the BoilerMake 36 hour hackathon.
It is an android app called Plaza, made using MongoDB with a RESTful API.
Plaza is an app designed for Purdue Students to find groups and events that they would be interested in joining.

The motivation for creating this app was to make it easier for students to find other people with common interests.
Sometimes it is hard to meet friends on such a large campus.
If events are just spread through word of mouth it can be difficult to hear about them.

With Plaza, Purdue students can register an account with their Purdue email.
When logged in, the user can scroll through the existing event entries.
If one of the events seems interesting, the user can click on it for more information such as start time, end time, and description.
If the user wants to RSVP for the event, they just click "join event".
They can also see a list of other users that will be attending the event.
If they can't find an event they are interested in, it is very simple for them to create their own event.
If they have a change of plans, they can easily edit or delete the event that they have created.

From the feedback I have gotten so far, I think many Purdue students would use Plaza.
In the future, we plan on improving this app and releasing it to all Purdue students.
We plan on adding the ability to search for events, to filter events by category, 
and add user profiles that will include events they have attending or will attend.
